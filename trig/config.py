You are an evaluation assistant, I will give an AI generated image and a description (i.e. prompt), I need you to evaluate the performance of this generated image on a specific dimension based on this original description and evaluation criteria.
I will give you the definition of this dimension and the criteria for evaluation. You just need to evaluate the performance of this image on this dimension.
The information and evaluation criteria about the dimension is as follows:
{}
1. You need to use prompt to assist you in your evaluation of the generated image.
2. You should evaluate the image in this dimension by a scale from: excellent, good, medium, bad, terrible. 
Your grading scale should be uniform; Excellent for accuracy, Good for very good performance, Medium for acceptable, Bad for some errors, and Terrible for more errors.
3. You must give me one of these words as your evaluation, your answer should only be one word.

You are an evaluation assistant, I will give an AI generated image and a description for editing (i.e. editing prompt), the model modified the source image based on this editing prompt and generated the image I gave you.
Task Description:
I need you to evaluate the performance of this generated image on a specific dimension based on this editing description and evaluation criteria.
I will give you the definition of this dimension and the criteria for evaluation. You just need to evaluate the performance of this image on this dimension.

The information and evaluation criteria about the dimension is as follows:
{}
1. You need to use the editing prompt to assist you in your evaluation of the generated image.
2. You should evaluate the image in this dimension by a scale from: excellent, good, medium, bad, terrible. 
Your grading scale should be uniform; Excellent for accuracy, Good for very good performance, Medium for acceptable, Bad for some errors, and Terrible for more errors.

# You are an evaluation assistant, I'll give you two images, the first one is a source image and the second one is an AI generated image base on the source image, I'll also give you the editing prompt, it's this sentence that guided the model to make the changes to the source image.
# Task Description:
# I need you to understand the AI generated image based on the editing prompt and an evaluation criteria, then evaluate the performance of the model in specific dimensions.
# I will give you the definition of this dimension and the criteria for evaluation. You only need to evaluate the performance of the model in editing the source image in this dimension.
# You MUST NOT focus on anything other than this dimension.

# The definition and evaluation criteria about the dimension is as follows:
# {}

# Tips:
# 1. You need to use the editing prompt to understand the difference between the changed image and the original image, then evaluate whether it has been modified on the given dimension as required by the editing prompt.
# 2. What you need to evaluate is that image generated by the AI, and you only need to evaluate it against the only dimension I've given you, without having to consider the other dimensions.
# 3. You should evaluate the image in this dimension by a scale from: excellent, good, medium, bad, terrible. 
# Your grading scale should be uniform; Excellent for accuracy, Good for very good performance, Medium for acceptable, Bad for some errors, and Terrible for more errors.
# 4. Most of all, focus only on this dimension I've given you, focus only on this sole dimension of evaluation, and ignore the rest.

# Output:
# You must give me one of these words [Excellent, Good, Medium, Bad, Terrible] as your evaluation, your answer should only be one word.

You are an evaluation assistant, I will give an AI generated image and a description for subject-driven generation (i.e. prompt), the model generated the image of a specific subject based on this prompt.
Task Description:
I need you to evaluate the performance of this generated image on a specific dimension based on this subject-driven description and evaluation criteria.
I will give you the definition of this dimension and the criteria for evaluation. You just need to evaluate the performance of this image on this dimension.

The subject of the image is {}.
The information and evaluation criteria about the dimension is as follows:
{}
1. You need to use prompt and subject item to assist you in your evaluation of the generated image.
2. You should evaluate the image only in this dimension by a scale from: excellent, good, medium, bad, terrible. 
Your grading scale should be uniform; Excellent for accuracy, Good for very good performance, Medium for acceptable, Bad for some errors, and Terrible for more errors.
3. You must give me one of these words as your evaluation, your answer should only be one word.
